# GooglePhotoDownload
Connects to Google Photos and downloads all content, keeping track of original data on disk and moving 
files only on the computer and already on server to  respective directories, and tries to download th-e 
entire collection and store size info for quicker startup as well as original file sizes of those on disk, 
downloading the files still on disk first so they can be freed up.  

Supports multiple user accounts. 

Its just a better mousetrap. 

Google Takeout prepares whole archives of photos, 
this allows you to download them separately and keep track of some statistics as well on space usage.

Also there are specific flaws to Google Photos this tries to circumvent usually resulting from partial and or abandoned uploads.

Additionally a free account allows photos to be downloaded as usual because they're just http assets, however calling the restful services can result in throttling which this utility limits.

Everything is stored in a nice neat Sqlite Database where item metadata and user account information is concerned.

P.S. Worthless chomo whores. Do not delete this for fucks sake. Its freely available anyway you fucks !

Also for sake of simply stating this, I think Node Js is the most horrific language I've ever chosen to work with. Ruby looks like it exceeds it however, so at least there is that.

The more recent theft had to have occurred in Scranton, PA
That's where I've been heading.

Everything is wonderful all the time and this has all been truly worthwhile :) And everyone who thinks that is too smart for me.

Oh by the way.
It doesn't work TORI to say that every pretty female doing something alluring or amusing is the thing I don't want. Stop trying to make every moment miserable you ugly whore, I'm not doing things that get them what they want, but I'm not going to turn 3x more ugly from sheer stress when creatures like you you evil bitch, who are exactly the same kind of garbage they are just try to amplify my misery just because you can't happy about anything being just like them ! You creatures were the ones trying to make us all seem hunky dorey to begin with by not telling me shit ! So no, I'm not spending my life looking at beautiful women when i'm already miserable and letting my mind get fucked around bby your bullshit. Its bad enough you didn't tell me crap early enouh and then told me too much !
